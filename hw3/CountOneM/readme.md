## countOneM

Read two integers `i` and `j`, followed by a string from the input. Then set the value of `rsi` to the address of the `i`-th character and set the value of `rdi` to the address of the `j`-th character of this string.

Count the number of bits with a value of 1 in memory from `rsi` to `rdi` and print the result. The indices `i` and `j` are both 0-based.
