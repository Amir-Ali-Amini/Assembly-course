## Anagram

Write a program that takes two input strings from the user and determines whether they are anagrams of each other (i.e., they contain the same characters but in different orders).

### Input

The first line contains the first string, and the second line contains the second string. The strings only consist of lowercase English letters, and the lengths of both strings are guaranteed to be equal.

### Output

Print `True` if the two strings are anagrams, otherwise print `False`.

### Example

#### Input 1

```
racea
carae
```

#### Output 1

```
True
```
